# Testing Stuff

My personal workspace for trying out random stuff and experimenting with code.

## What's Here

- Random experiments
- Code snippets I'm testing
- Things I'm learning
- Stuff that might break

## Notes to Self

- Keep experiments in separate folders
- Comment what I was trying to do
- Date stuff if needed
- Delete things that didn't work out

## TODO

- [ ] Add more experiments
- [ ] Test that thing I saw on YouTube
- [ ] Try out the new framework
